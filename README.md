# Overview
One day I decided to make chess on my own. I tried SDL2, SFML and other libraries & frameworks but never really got into them. So I decided to wing it and do it in bare OpenGL. This is the result. It's still a WIP, but the game is playable and winnable.

This is my own take on it. I've seen a _Chess Programming Wiki_ and that they use something called _BitBoards_. I'll see that next.
